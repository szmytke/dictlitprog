function, A function is a block of organized; reusable code that is used to perform a single; related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. , https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm
parameter, A named entity in a function (or method) definition that specifies an argument (or in some cases; arguments) that the function can accept. , https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter
variable, Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory. , https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm
argument, A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function. , https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html
dictionary, Dictionaries are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary; you have an 'index' of words; and for each of them a definition. In python; the word is called a 'key'; and the definition a 'value'. , http://sthurlow.com/python/lesson06/
tuple, A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences; just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are; the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses; whereas lists use square brackets. , https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm
ASCII table, ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers; so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort. , http://www.asciitable.com/
module, Module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions; classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code. , https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm
class, A template for creating user-defined objects. Class definitions normally contain method definitions that operate on instances of the class. , https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
list, A built-in Python datatype; which is a mutable sorted sequence of values. Note that only sequence itself is mutable; it can contain immutable values like strings and numbers. Any Python first-class object can be placed in a tuple as a value. , https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
immutable, An object with fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers; strings and tuples. Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored. They play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed such as the keys of a dictionary. , https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
whitespace, The unconventional use of space characters (' ') to control the flow of a program. Instead of a loosely-enforced ideal; this is an integral part of Python syntax. It's a tradeoff between readability and flexibility in favor of the former. , https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
iterable, A container object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include all sequence types (list; str; tuple; etc.) and some non-sequence types like dict and file and objects of any classes you define with an "iter" or "getitem" method. , https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGlossary
list comprehension, A compact way to process all or part of the elements in a sequence and return a list with the results. , http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/cheatsheet/python-glossary
PEP 8, A set of recommendations how to write Python code. , http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/cheatsheet/python-glossaryslowo
